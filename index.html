            For the last 5 years, K-State has been experiencing a decline in its overall enrollment, and despite many efforts from the university to change the decline the skid only continues as <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/statistics/enrbyyr.html">2019</a> showed another decrease in enrollment. Now many would attribute the drop this year to the recent COVID-19 outbreak across the United States, but that doesn't explain the recent drops before this year.

    <p>
        According to the K-State Enrollment statistics provided by the <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/pa/data/student/studentfb/totdemo.Fall2020.pdf">Office of the Registrar</a> the Fall semester of 2018-2019 to 2019-2020 saw a 2.2% decrease in enrollment. The past few years have been seeing a steady drop in enrollment of around 2% while showing no signs of recovery.    
    </p>
</div>
<div id="main-text">
    <p>
        While these statistics are a worrying trend after coronavirus ravaged the earth, colleges all around the United States are seeing drops and, K-State isn't exempt from this. According to the Office of Registrar, K-State enrollment dropped 4% this fall a loss of 865 incoming students from the current calculations.</p>
</div>
<div id="main-text">
    <p>
        While many would consider this a worrying sign of the future Provost and Executive Vice President of Kansas State Charles Taber believes that the number could have been even worse.    </p>
</div>

<div id="main-text">
    <p>
    "I expected a larger enrollment decline following COVID, and the 4% decline was actually a positive sign relative to my expectations," Taber said.

<h3>College Breakdown</h3>

    <p>
        While enrollment numbers are a big piece of the puzzle to understand when looking at an issue of this magnitude the smaller details are something that gets overshadowed. For example, when breaking down the individual colleges and their enrollment numbers we can start to see which majors are being the most affected by the lack of new students.    </p>

        In February 2019, President Richard Myers spoke with the <a href="https://www.cjonline.com/news/20190221/kansas-state-university-president-richard-myers-voices-concern-over-state-higher-education-cuts">Rotary Club of Topeka</a> about how decreasing state aid to universities forced K-State to increase its  tuition to help fund the universities operations. Because of the recent increases, many would assume that's the main reason enrollment has been on the decline.

        According to the data gathered from the Office of Registrar, many colleges here at K-State took hits to their enrollment in the year 2019. The hardest-hit college was the College of Agriculture which saw a<a href="https://www.k-state.edu/pa/data/student/studentfb/totdemo.Fall2020.pdf"> 7.7%</a> decrease in its enrollment. The College of Arts and Sciences also saw a large decline in enrollment at 5.8%.

<div id="main-text">
    <P>
        Paige Gordon, a Junior majoring in Veterinary Medicine has noticed the recent decline in students in some of the classes she is taking. 
    </P>
</div>

<div id='main-text'>
    <p>
        "Compared to my first year of college I've been noticing bit by bit that the number of students that are enrolled in the classes I am taking have been smaller every semester and these classes arent pertaining to my major," Gordon said.
    </p>

</div>

<h3>Countermeasures</h3>

<div id="main-text">
    <p>
       To counteract the recent downturn in enrollment K-State has been creating many programs to entice new students to the university. One example is reducing the GPA requirements for the <a href="https://www.kstatecollegian.com/2019/04/02/scholarship-gpa-requirements-lowering-for-fall-2019-at-k-state/#:~:text=Effective%20in%20the%20fall%202020,3.0%20GPA%2C%20down%20from%203.5.&text=when%20their%20scholarships%20renew%20for,to%20be%20at%20a%203.0.">2020-2021 semester.  </a>
    </p>
</div>

<div id="main-text">
    <p>
        With Covid-19 being the main proprietor for the most recent drop Taber outlined changes on the horizon  to address the issues.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="main-text">
    <P>
    "We are improving communication with students through better technology; we have chosen not to increase tuition for several years in a row, and we have begun a Tuition and Fee Structure Task Force to develop a new tuition and fees approach; we have worked with faculty to provide the best educational experience that we can under current conditions," Taber said.</P>
